## Introduction and adoption of the agenda (Angelo)
Try to find and solve the reasons for current general hesitation to use VTL. Target audiences to convince: 
-	Users: good doc, training, get started guides
-	Managers: SDMX sponsors to communicate on task force relaunch, spread in other communities 
Having and knowing about available user tools is very important. Better advertise VTL tools: self-declaring and integrated with SDMX tools
Clarify VTL business case (video?)

Current initiatives:
-	INSEE: implemented TREVAS engine for distributed environments
